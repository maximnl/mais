Name:               TEST SQL FOR A_SP_FC_REG
Author:             PLANSIS
Written:            2023-08-23
Purpose:            A linear (ARIMA) regression model automation. Transforms input time series (value1 per day) into output time series based on time-lagged categories, day of the week, and regression parameters from the file_source table.
Comments:           Timelag is organized into time categories: 0 - today, 1 - yesterday, 2 - two days ago, 3 - 3 to 6 days ago, 4 - 7 - 2 weeks ago.
                    This test SQL is intended to be wrapped into an EXEC of an SQL string. The commented parameters are to be passed as strings.
Affected table(s):  [A_FACT_DAY]
Parameter(s):       @param1 - regression parameters selection, use file_id=??? selection from [A_SOURCE_FILE] table.
```

Here's the adapted description for the business users, explaining the columns in the `A_SOURCE_FILE` table that provide regression parameters for the stored procedure:

```plaintext
The stored procedure uses data from the 'A_SOURCE_FILE' table to extract regression parameters needed for the forecasting process. These parameters influence the transformation of input time series data into output time series predictions. Below is a description of the columns in the 'A_SOURCE_FILE' table that are utilized:

- Column 'A' (ACT_ID): This column contains the activity ID that corresponds to the forecasted activity. Each unique activity ID represents a specific type of activity for which predictions are being made.

- Column 'B' (ACT_NAME): This column contains the name of the activity associated with the activity ID. It provides a descriptive label for the activity, helping to identify its nature.

- Column 'C' (Parameterset): This column represents the parameter set category. It categorizes the regression parameters based on specific sets or configurations, allowing different parameter sets to be used for different types of forecasts.

- Column 'D' (offset): This column contains the offset value used in the regression process. The offset parameter influences the time lag applied to the input time series data, contributing to the prediction calculation.

- Column 'E' (lnc): Short for "lagged and categorized," this column's value indicates whether lagging and categorization are applied to the input data. It affects how historical data is considered in the prediction process.

- Columns 'F' to 'K' (d1 to d6): These columns represent the days of the week (from Monday to Sunday) and their respective binary indicators. A value of 1 for a specific day's column indicates that the prediction model considers that day as part of the calculation, while a value of 0 excludes it.

- Column 'L' (formula): This column represents an additional exponential addition parameter. It contributes to the formula used in the prediction process, allowing for fine-tuning of the forecasting model.

In summary, the 'A_SOURCE_FILE' table provides crucial regression parameters that determine how the stored procedure transforms historical data into predictive insights. These parameters encompass time lagging, day-of-week considerations, and other factors that influence the accuracy of the forecasting model.

Below is a breakdown of the key parts of the stored procedure:

1. **Input Parameters:**
   - `@activity_id`, `@forecast_id`, `@session_id`, `@commands`, `@procedure_name`, `@site_id`, `@import_id`, `@category`:
   - These parameters are used to customize the behavior of the stored procedure based on the specific requirements.

2. **Initialization and Configuration:**
   - The `SET` statements are used to configure settings for the session, such as ANSI_NULLS and QUOTED_IDENTIFIER.
   - The stored procedure begins with the `BEGIN` statement.

3. **Cursor Initialization (`TAB_CURSOR`):**
   - A cursor named `TAB_CURSOR` is declared to iterate over records from the `[dbo].[A_IMPORT_RUN]` table. This table seems to store configuration details for different imports.

4. **Loop Through Imports:**
   - The stored procedure then enters a loop using the cursor to process each import configuration.

5. **Schedule Test:**
   - The `@schedule` parameter is evaluated to determine if the import should be executed based on a specified schedule. The result is stored in the `@on_schedule` variable.

6. **Parameters Test:**
   - Various parameters such as `@filter`, `@source`, and `@fields_source` are checked to ensure they are properly configured. Errors and warnings are logged if necessary.

7. **DELETE DAY Step:**
   - Data is deleted from the `[A_FACT_DAY]` table based on the provided filter and date range.

8. **INSERT DAY Step:**
   - Data is transformed and inserted into the `[A_FACT_DAY]` table using complex calculations involving exponential and time-lagged functions.

9. **IMPORT SUMMARY:**
   - Various statistics are collected and logged for each import iteration, including errors, warnings, deleted records, inserted records, updated records, and duration.

10. **Logging and Output:**
    - The stored procedure logs various actions and results using the `[A_SP_SYS_LOG]` procedure.
    - Progress, warnings, and errors are also printed to the output.
    - The stored procedure finishes execution, and the loop continues to the next import configuration.

11. **Cursor Cleanup:**
    - After the loop, the cursor is closed and deallocated.

12. **Final Logging:**
    - The overall results of the stored procedure's execution are logged, including the total number of imports processed, errors, warnings, and duration.

It's important to note that this stored procedure is quite complex and seems to involve data transformation, querying, conditional execution, and logging. It's primarily designed for data manipulation related to time-series forecasting. Business users interacting with this stored procedure would typically set input parameters to define the scope of the data processing and receive feedback on the success, warnings, or errors of the operation.
